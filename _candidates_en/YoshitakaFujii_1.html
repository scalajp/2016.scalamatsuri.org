<p>
At my work, we use Domain Driven Development to develop our products.
Since DDD is nothing more than a designing technique, there are many opinions around the implementation, and we think there's no one true way. Through our daily development, we iterate towards more faithful way of putting DDD into implementation as well as more idiomatic Scala. It's a cycle of discussion and implementation.

In this session, I will show the communication between the stacked layers and some of the patterns to keep the domain model.
