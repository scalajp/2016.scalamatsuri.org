<p>Our team has been developing new web services with Play framework since this year. In this session, I will talk "how do we manage play framework application in production environment" based on a lot of problems which we have experienced, such as an integration with Docker, database migration, monitoring. </p>
<p>I hope that this session will help people who want to use Scala but worry about practical operation in production environment.</p>
