<p>
Basic text mining with Japanese is possible today by using a mix of ScalaNLP, Kuromoji and Spark's mllib.  Although not as powerful as the Stanford NLP group of libraries (which don't currently support Japanese), fairly sophisticated solutions are possible.
</p>

<p>
In this talk I'll go over how to get Kuromoji working inside Spark and demonstrate using Spark's LDA implementation for anomaly analysis and using Word2Vec and word embedding for generating recommendations from free text.
</p>

<p>
As a talk for beginners I will keep the math to a minimum and instead focus on code demos and showcasing pitfalls.
