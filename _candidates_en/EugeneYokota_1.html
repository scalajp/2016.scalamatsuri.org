<p>
In this talk eed3si9n, the author of 'learning Scalaz' and 'herding Cats,'
illustrates functional programming in Scala that is enabled by libraries like Scalaz and Cats.
Starting from the basics like, the advantage over the standard library, and what the libraries offer,
he intends to bring it up to category theory and a way to find monads.</p>
