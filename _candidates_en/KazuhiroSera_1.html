<p>I'm both at once one of the active contributors of Scalatra, json4s and the founder of ScalikeJDBC and Skinny Framework.</p>
<p>We, Scala hackers in Japan, live on the opposite side of the world from Americas and EU. So when we wake up in the morning, we see developers there are usually going to bed on GitHub comments or gitter chat. In addition, for some reasons, most of us including me are not fluent in English. English is not a common ability for Scala ninajas at least at this time.</p>
<p>In this talk, I'd like to share my experience on Scala OSS and introduce great Scala ninjas in Japan to the people of the world.</p>
