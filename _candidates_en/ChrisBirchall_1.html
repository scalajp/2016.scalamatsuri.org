<p>Ever since I heard the rumour that compilation involved 27 phases, I've kept my distance from scalac, telling myself that people smarter than me were taking care of it. But it's time to stop living in ignorance and fear. Let's tame the compiler!
</p><p>First I’ll give a quick overview of scalac, showing how the codebase is structured. Then I’ll walk through what it actually does to turn your Scala source files into Java bytecode, looking at some of those infamous phases along the way. Finally there will be a live-coding demo showing how easy it is to start hacking on the compiler.</p>
