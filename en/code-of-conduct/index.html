<h1>Code of conduct</h1>

<p>
  Scala Matsuri is dedicated to providing an open conference for all technologists from various regions and communities. We want to make it a fun experience for everyone, regardless of gender, race, and many different backgrounds. All participants, including speakers and sponsors, are asked to be respectful to each other and comply with the following Code of conduct.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
  All communication should be appropriate for a technology conference with professional audience including people of many different backgrounds. Scala Matsuri does not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form.
</p>
<p>
  We expect all participants, including guests, exhibitors, sponsors, booth staff, and the organizers, to follow these rules at all conference venues and conference-related social events. Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior (regardless of the intention) are expected to comply immediately.
</p>

<p>
  Harassment includes, but is not limited to:
  <ul>
    <li>Asking other participants out (comments about appearance, romatic or sextual interest) or inappropriate physical contact.</li>
    <li>Offensive verbal comments or discriminatory behaviors related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, age, race, nationality, ethnicity, or religion.</li>
    <li>Sexual images in public spaces.</li>
    <li>Deliberate intimidation; stalking, following, harassing photography or recording.</li>
    <li>Sustained disruption of talks or other events.</li>
    <li>Use of sexualized images, activities, or other material during the session.</li>
    <li>Use of sexualized clothing/uniforms/costumes by the booth staff or volunteers, or otherwise creating sexualized environment in the booth or the displayed material.</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
  If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the conference organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the conference with no refund. All participants, including guests, exhibitors, sponsors, booth staff, must comply to the order by the conference organizers immediately without condition.
</p>
<p>
  The code of conduct is subject to change without notice.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
  Similar code of conduct have been adopted by PNW Scala, NE Scala, and Scala Days to provide a harassment-free conference. We also support the cause.
