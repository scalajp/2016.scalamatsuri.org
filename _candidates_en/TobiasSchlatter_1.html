<p>This talk will give you a deep insight into the moving parts that were
required to make Scala.js production ready. After laying out the
internal parts of the Scala.js compilation, linking and optimization
pipeline, we deep-dive into selected components in an attempt to
demystify Scalac's JavaScript back-end.</p>
