You might have heard of the term <i>Deep Learning</i> recently.
</p>
<p>
It's an approach to maching learning that are used for pattern matching and perception of unstructured data such as images, sound, and text. It's known for high expressiveness and accurary due to stacking layers of neurons, and fast learning thanks to the power of GPU.
</p><p>
In this talk, I will explain the basics of neural network, what you need to get started with Deep Learning using Scala, and show a DSL to use DeepLearning4j easily from Scala.
